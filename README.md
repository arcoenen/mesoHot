# mesoHot

This repository contains MATLAB routines to analyze the impact of sea surface height on the biogeochemistry of Station ALOHA as measured during the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) for the 1993-2015 period.
Sea surface height was produced and distributed by the Copernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS, http://www.marine.copernicus.eu). HOT observations were downloaded from the Hawaii Ocean Time-series Data Organization & Graphical System (HOT-DOGS, http://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/hot-dogs/).

Requirements:
- Matlab ver 2013b or above
- Gibbs SeaWater (GSW) Oceanographic Toolbox of TEOS-10 available rom http://www.TEOS-10.org
- lsqfitgm.m, lsqfitx.m and lsqfity.m available from http://www.mbari.org/index-of-downloadable-files/ (by E.T. Peltzer) 
- readHotDogs.m

The data/ folder contains altimetric data and HOT observations from the upper 200 m of the water column
